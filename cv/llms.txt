## Philosophy

I believe attention is the single most valuable resource we have. As a Vipassana practitioner (a meditation technique focused on self-observation and mindfulness), I've learned that where we direct our awareness shapes our reality. This is why I reject the model where we can pay for someone else's attention - the foundation of current social media platforms. My 7 years managing ads/SEO and understanding how the digital world runs on data surveillance and behavioral targeting taught me exactly why we need to build a different web.

I spent the last decade focused on SEO and educational content because search is about delivering what users are actually looking for, not manipulating their attention. Now I'm shifting from educational platforms to building Micro-SaaS and apps that genuinely fulfill needs. I've lived 2 years purely on volunteering while traveling as a digital nomad.

To any new research, I try to find the path with the highest harvesting of insights. I prioritize understanding the "why" before the "how" - like grasping the problem space and user needs before diving into solution implementation, or studying consensus trade-offs before picking a blockchain protocol. This foundational understanding creates a mental framework that makes absorbing subsequent details significantly faster and more meaningful.

I have friends working in all different fields and I always try to keep my network active by exchanging experiences they have in different ecosystems and technology stacks. This cross-pollination of ideas from fintech, gaming, enterprise software, and open-source communities has shaped how I approach problems and identify patterns that others might miss.

Data-driven builder focused on rapid prototyping. Ship MVPs, instrument with analytics, measure engagement, iterate based on metrics. Build in public, self-host infrastructure, optimize for long-term maintainability after validation. Currently exploring how to apply quantum computing to Web3 infrastructure challenges.
