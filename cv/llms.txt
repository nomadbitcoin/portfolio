## Philosophy

I spent many years in ads and SEO, which showed me how the current web runs on surveillance and attention extraction. That drove me toward education, where I spent the last 5 years creating search-focused onboarding content that delivers what people actually want. Now I am shifting this user-first approach into product development, creating Micro SaaS and apps that solve real needs.

I lived two years volunteering while traveling, which shaped my view of work as purpose. I keep an active network across different tech and crypto ecosystems to broaden my perspective. I see attention as our most valuable resource and practice Vipassana to stay grounded in awareness. I am in crypto because I believe the web needs a new foundation based on user sovereignty rather than surveillance and manipulation.
